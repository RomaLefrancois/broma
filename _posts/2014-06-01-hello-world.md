Welcome to [Broma](http://romalefrancois.github.io/broma), the perfect companion to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the popular static site generator.
Broma is an elegant, open source, fully responsive theme for Jekyll. It includes lightweight styles and placeholder content to get you up and running with a simple blog in no time.

### Features

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, 404, posts, and page)
* Fully responsive, so it works great on all devices

### Browser support

Broma is a rather forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Documentation

Docs for setting up and customizing Broma can be found in the [project readme on GitHub](https://github.com/romalefrancois/broma#readme).
